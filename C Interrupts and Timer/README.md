Goal: 
To program the AVR timer.
To use interrupts for the timer.
To use the switch to generate digital inputs.
To drive LED.

2 parts:

Part 1) Write a program using a Timer to toggle the LED every three seconds.
Requirement: use C programming language, and use the interrupt to drive the timer, not the
delay function. First, use the timer in normal mode. Then reimplement using the CTC
mode. You may use Timer 0 or 1 or 2 depending on your needs.

Part 2) Connect a switch to a port of your selection similar to the figure below. Using
Timer/Counter0, write a program such that, when the switch is pressed, blink the LED on
the microcontroller for 10 times. Note that you do not need to use external LED.
