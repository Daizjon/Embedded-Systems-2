# Mega2560 RGB LED Control

This project demonstrates RGB LED control using an Arduino Mega 2560. The RGB LED is driven through digital output pins with current-limiting resistors, allowing color transitions over time.

## Objective
- Interface and drive an RGB LED using Arduino programming
- Control color output through timed alternation of RGB channels
- Apply proper current limiting using inline resistors

## Hardware Used
- Elegoo / Arduino Mega 2560 R3
- RGB LED (common anode or cathode depending on wiring)
- Three 220Ω resistors (one per color channel)
- Breadboard
- Male-to-male jumper wires

## Key Concepts
- Digital output pin control
- Current limiting with resistors
- Basic timing and color sequencing logic
- Embedded programming using Arduino IDE

## File
- `RGB_LED.ino` – Main Arduino source file controlling LED behavior

This project reinforces hardware interfacing fundamentals and embedded programming concepts on the ATmega2560 platform.
