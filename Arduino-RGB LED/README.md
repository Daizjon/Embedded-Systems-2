Goal:
To drive an RGB LED through a board and arduino programming. RGB LEDS are like 3 regular LEDs in one. Connected resistors inline (3 total) so we can limit the current being drawn.

Hardware Bill:
1) x Elegoo Mega 2560 R3
(1) x 830 Tie Points Breadboard
(4) x M-M wires (Male to Male jumper wires)
(1) x RGB LED
(3) x 220 ohm resistors
